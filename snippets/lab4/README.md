# Exercise: Secure RPC-based Authentication Service

An extension of the exemplified RPC infrastructure has been created to support an authentication service.

A token is needed to read a registered user's information and verify that an user password is correct.

The token is provided by file and must be generated by an authentication of a user who has the admin role.

If this does not happen or the token is invalid, the user is notified of the various errors.

Compared to the previous implementation, this check has been added to the get and check commands of the client cli.

To start the server:

``` python -m snippets -l 4 -e 2 PORT ```

To get a user's information from the client cli after successful authentication:

``` python -m snippets -l 4 -e 4 SERVER_IP:PORT get -u USER -t TOKEN_FILE_NAME ```

Check if a user's password is correct from the client cli after successful authentication:

``` python -m snippets -l 4 -e 4 SERVER_IP:PORT check -u USER -p PASSWORD -t TOKEN_FILE_NAME ```

TOKEN_FILE_NAME is the path of the file where the token is saved.
